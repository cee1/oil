    <para>
      The oilcore module mainly provides the concepts of function class and implement.
    </para>
    <para>
      A function class typically has two or more implements. These implements have the same prototype and function, and only one of them is activated, which means a public function pointer corresponding to the function class(a slot) point that implement.

    <para>
    You can use oilcore to manager a list of function classes and implements, and plug the best implement for each class into the corresponding slot, according to what features the CURRENT CPU has and some pre-done tests. The tests can be performed with another module of oil -- oiltest.
