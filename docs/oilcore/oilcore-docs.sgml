    <title>OIL Core functions</title>
    <para>
      The OIL Core functions provide a mechanism of registering new function class and adding new implement to an existing function class.
    </para>
    <para>
      A function class typically has two or more implements. These implements have the same prototype and function, and only one of them is activated, which means a public function pointer corresponding to the function class point that implement.
    </para>
    <para>
    You can using oilcore to manager a list of function classes and implements, and select the best implement for each class, according to what features the CURRENT CPU has and some pre-done tests. The tests can be performed with another module of oil -- oiltest.
